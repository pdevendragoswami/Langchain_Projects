I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others.

That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

He expresses gratitude for the opportunity to serve as the President for five years and shares his experiences and insights gained during his tenure. He highlights 10 important messages that he has learned from his interactions with people from various walks of life, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development and fulfilling the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "3. Seeding agricultural growth and ensuring food security\n",
      "4. Defeating problems and succeeding through perseverance\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through partnerships and collaborations\n",
      "6. Showing courage in the face of calamities and disasters\n",
      "7. Fostering connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "8. Defending the nation and its sovereignty\n",
      "9. Empowering youth to contribute to the nation's development\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He assures her that it is a thoughtful question and expresses his commitment to working towards India's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and acknowledged it as thoughtful. They assured that the person's dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering India's youth and villages to achieve prosperity and development. The speaker, likely the President of India, reflects on his experiences meeting with young people and villagers, and highlights the need to provide physical connectivity (roads) and empower village councils to take decisions and manage their development. The speech also mentions a specific initiative, the Periyar PURA complex, which aims to provide urban amenities to rural areas, including physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic growth and employment generation. Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of empowering India's youth and villages to achieve a prosperous and developed India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Provision of Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) project in a village. The project has led to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs\n",
      "* Development of 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land\n",
      "* Villagers engaging in various activities such as cultivation, power generation, food processing, and marketing\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has also enabled the villagers to develop internationally competitive products, with the help of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of PURAs in bridging the rural-urban divide, stating that the whole country needs around 7000 such projects to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences they had. The first experience was meeting over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the importance of empowering farmers to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve the nation's economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience was meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person with no hands and legs, who was smiling and radiant despite his physical limitations. Krishna Murthy expressed gratitude to God, his parents, teachers, and others for giving him confidence, training, and help, and stated that he wanted to sing in front of the speaker. The speaker was touched by Krishna Murthy's positive attitude and willingness to overcome his challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two themes: overcoming physical challenges through the power of music and overcoming the impact of disaster through partnership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares a personal experience where they met a physically challenged person who had a hidden talent for music. Despite his physical limitations, he had a positive attitude and was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others to pursue his passion. He performed in front of the speaker and showcased his talent, inspiring others with his story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second theme is about the resilience of the people of Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited a village, Urusa, which had been severely affected by the disaster. Despite the massive losses, the villagers were determined to rebuild their lives and had praise for the rescue and relief efforts of the Army, Air Force, and state government. The speaker commends the villagers for their courage and determination in overcoming their problems, rather than allowing them to become their master.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is reminiscing about two instances where they witnessed courage in the face of calamities. Firstly, during a relief operation after an earthquake, they saw children and villagers participating bravely alongside the Armed Forces and interacting with them, with the school functioning normally in temporary tents. Secondly, in 2005, they visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami and were touched by the unique response of the tribal islanders, who took in affected victims as their own and showed no signs of despair. The speaker, inspired by their courage, composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" and sang it with the islanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a satellite, fiber optic, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at a cost of $100 million. As part of the project, 12 universities (7 from India, 5 from Africa), 17 hospitals (12 from India, 5 from Africa), and 53 tele-medicine and education centers in Africa will be connected. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, with Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students, and CARE Hospital providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is highlighting two significant achievements in India's relationship with Africa and its defense forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, the speaker mentions that India has been providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in cardiology and radiology since November 2006, using the Pan African network. This has enabled instant communication between the heads of state in all 53 African countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, citing personal experiences he has had visiting various military units and interacting with soldiers, sailors, and air warriors. He notes that the defense forces are on a \"beautiful mission\" to guard the nation and remain vigilant to counter any threats, even in adverse circumstances. The speaker also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces and police personnel in ensuring the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the speaker mentions his meeting with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming young people into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a program that has been training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh's districts, particularly in Medak district, with visible results such as increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and recognition of duties towards the nation. The speaker shares an example of a student who successfully weaned her father off smoking after being inspired by the program's 10-point oath. They express confidence that this program is empowering the youth, citing the 540 million Indian youth under the age of 25 as a powerful resource. The speaker concludes by highlighting the diversity and unity of India's culture and tradition, and the efforts being made to shape the country's future through value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and civilizational heritage while pursuing economic growth. They believe it is the duty of the current generation to ensure a better future for the next generation. The speaker expresses confidence in India's potential to become a developed nation by 2020, citing the country's progress over the past 60 years, its natural resources, and the hard work of its people, particularly its 540 million youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also quotes a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" and encourages the youth to aim high and believe that their dreams will come true. They urge citizens to work together to achieve the mission of a developed India by 2020, with a focus on reducing the rural-urban divide, ensuring equitable access to energy and water, promoting a harmonious relationship between agriculture, industry, and services, providing education with values to all, and making India a destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a utopian nation where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is accessible to all\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated\n",
      "* Everyone feels included and not alienated\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with a sustainable growth path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, expresses his gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the past five years. He shares his life mission to bring connectivity and self-confidence to the people of India, emphasizing that they can achieve great things. He concludes by wishing the country's development by 2020 and ends with a prayer and a patriotic slogan, \"Jai Hind\".\n",

The project includes connecting 12 universities, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa, with a pilot project already commissioned in Ethiopia.

Kalam emphasizes the significance of overcoming problems through partnership and courage in combating calamities.

He also shares a personal experience of meeting a talented individual who, despite being physically challenged, had a positive attitude and perseverance, which allowed his latent talent to blossom.\n",
